# BrainBoost

**AI for Learning and Developer Productivity**

This repository contains the design and planning documents for *BrainBoost*, an AI‑powered system aimed at enhancing learning and developer productivity.

## 🧠 Project Overview

*BrainBoost* is envisioned as a suite of AI tools and features that help learners and developers work smarter — for example:

- Intelligent code suggestions and automation workflows
- Learning assistants that provide insights or resources
- AI‑driven productivity enhancements tailored to developers

> ⚙️ *Note:* This repo currently contains planning documents (`design.md` and `requirements.md`). Development is in early stages.

## 📄 What’s Inside

- **design.md** – Concept and architecture ideas  
- **requirements.md** – Feature requirements and planning notes

These files capture the early design and requirements for the project.

## 🛠️ Technologies (planned)

Although the codebase isn’t implemented yet, the project is intended to use tools like:

- Python / JavaScript (for AI integration)
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Natural Language Processing (for intelligent suggestions)
- Web or CLI interfaces for developer workflows

> This section can be updated as features are implemented.
